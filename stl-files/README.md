# STL Files  

This directory contains all the **STL (Stereolithography)** files required for the construction and assembly of this project.  
These designs were created using **Fusion 360** and later sliced using **Cura**.  

## Notes  

- The main frame that connects the motor to the wheel is unstable. Some modifications are required, which I plan to make manually rather than using software.  
- All STL files are designed to ensure compatibility with the projectâ€™s specifications. If you plan to build something similar, I recommend modifying the frame to fit your motor's dimensions.  
- These files should only be printed with **100% infill**; using a lower infill percentage is not advised.
